# Companies are named files

A player keeps any number of Companies. Each one has a name and a logo, and the title screen lists
them. The browser stores one Game per Company, behind an index that carries the few figures the
title screen needs.

Before this, the browser held one Company under `quorum.save.v2`. Starting another Company
overwrote the first, and the founding settings were the Founder's "next Company" fields rather than
a property of the Company that started. The GDD asked for three save slots ([Interface and game
feel](https://wiki.playquorum.dev/design/15-ui-ux#save)); a fixed number is a limit with no engineering purpose, so the
index has no cap.

## Decision

1. The player names a Company and picks its logo before founding it. The name and logo belong to
   the Company file, not to the Founder and not to the Game: the Simulation never reads them.
2. `quorum.saves.v1` holds the index: `current`, and one entry per Company with its id, name, logo,
   Venture, Mutators, timestamps, and the Era, Users, and time the title screen lists.
3. One Game lives under `quorum.save.v3.<id>`, with the Company's disclosure and Dashboard history.
   An autosave writes that Company and the index, never another Company.
4. `apps/web` owns the index, the logos, and the founding draft. `packages/simulation` keeps the
   Game, the Founding, and the Venture and Mutator rules; a Company's name reaches the history row
   at Exit, because that row records the Company ([Exit and Legacy](https://wiki.playquorum.dev/design/13-prestige#company-history)).
5. The pre-public single save `quorum.save.v2` is gone. Public saves carry their own `format`
   ([A Company save carries a format version](0023-a-company-save-has-a-format.md)).
6. Exiting a Company deletes its file: an exited Company cannot be continued. Its history row and
   Legacy stay with the Founder.

## Consequences

- Loading a Company is explicit: the index loads the current Company in the background for Continue,
  and the Companies page opens any other file. A Company is never resumed from a stale in-memory
  board when its file says otherwise.
- The index duplicates the Venture and Mutators so the Companies page never decodes every Game.
  `founding` in the Game stays the source of truth; the index is a cache for the list.
- Export and import as text ([Interface and game feel](https://wiki.playquorum.dev/design/15-ui-ux#save)) serializes one Company file with its metadata and replaces the open Company's Game. The file boundary made it a serialization, not a new format.
