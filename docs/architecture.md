# Architecture

## Runtime boundaries

`apps/web` and `apps/backend` are separate deployable applications. The browser sends requests to the website origin. The website Worker forwards `/api/*` requests to the API Worker through an Alchemy-managed service binding. Alchemy deploys both Workers in one stack.

```text
Browser / Foldkit
       │ same-origin /api/rpc
       ▼
Website Worker ── service binding ──► API Worker
                                           │
                                           ▼
                                      Effect RPC
                                           │
                                           ▼
                                      packages/rpc
```

`apps/wiki` is a third deployable application with no API. Foldkit prerenders every page at build time, and `Cloudflare.Website.Foldkit` serves the files; its generated Worker answers only 404s ([ADR 0009](adr/0009-the-wiki-is-a-prerendered-app.md)).

The service binding is a deployment concern. Business handlers must not depend on Cloudflare types or bindings. The root `alchemy.run.ts` owns all resource declarations and selects the default website or reference example by Alchemy stage (`reference` selects the example). Each app exposes a plain `src/worker.ts` runtime entry module; these modules do not import Alchemy or declare infrastructure.

## Request routing

`packages/rpc/src/paths.ts` owns `API_PREFIX` and `RPC_PATH`. `alchemy.run.ts` derives the website's `runWorkerFirst` rule from `API_PREFIX`, so the path that the contract declares and the path that the deployment routes cannot drift apart.

The website Worker therefore receives only requests under that prefix, and forwards them to the API Worker through the service binding. Every other path is served from the static assets, including the client-side fallback for unmatched routes.

The API Worker sets `workersDev: false`. The website origin is its only public surface, so a caller cannot skip the website Worker by addressing the API directly.

## Telemetry

Sentry records errors, traces, and profiles ([ADR 0013](./adr/0013-sentry-for-errors-traces-and-profiles.md)). Cloudflare Workers Observability keeps logs only: `alchemy.run.ts` turns its traces off, so a request is traced once. Observability is configured on the host resources in `alchemy.run.ts`, never in contexts.

- The browser starts Sentry in `apps/web/src/platform/sentry.ts`. Foldkit's `crash` and `slow` options report to it; `traced` wraps work that matters to load time or smoothness.
- Both Workers wrap their entry with `Sentry.withSentry`. They need the `nodejs_compat` flag, which `sentryCompatibility` sets. The API Worker also provides the Effect tracer, logger, and error reporter, so `Effect.withSpan` in a context becomes a Sentry span.
- The browser sends trace headers to `/api/` only. The website Worker passes them through the service binding, so one trace covers the browser, both Workers, and D1.
- Sampling: traces 10%, profiles 5% of sessions. Review both after a week of real traffic.

## Product analytics

The browser sends anonymous PostHog events through the website Worker at `/q` (`INGEST_PREFIX` in `packages/rpc/src/paths.ts`). The Worker forwards them to PostHog Cloud US; the browser never calls PostHog directly, so ad blockers do not match the hostname.

- `apps/web/src/platform/analytics.ts` owns the SDK, the session, and the heartbeat.
- `apps/web/src/game/analytics-bridge.ts` maps the playtest log to the nine events the plan keeps.
- `apps/web/src/game/analytics-budget.ts` caps a session at 80 events and a device at 600 a month. Funnel events bypass the session cap, never the month cap.
- `apps/wiki/src/platform/analytics.ts` sends `$pageview` for the wiki in the same project.
- `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` is required at build time for both apps. Without it, the SDK never loads and nothing is sent.
- Settings has **Share anonymous usage data**. The policy is `apps/wiki/content/about/privacy.md`.

## Code ownership

- `apps/web/src/app` owns the Foldkit application. Remote data belongs in Foldkit Query submodels. Update handlers decide when to load or revalidate them. A flow with exclusive phases is a `foldkit/experimental/machine` definition beside its tagged state union, not a set of nullable fields ([ADR 0011](adr/0011-state-machines-are-for-flows.md)); [State machines](state-machines.md) lists every machine and the properties it holds. `src/game/update.ts` routes Messages; a subject's handlers live in `src/game/update/<subject>.ts` and its Message cases in `src/game/message/<subject>.ts` ([ADR 0015](adr/0015-update-handlers-live-by-subject.md)).
- `apps/backend/src/contexts` is the home for server-side bounded contexts as product vocabulary is discovered. Do not pre-invent product domains in the scaffold.
- `apps/wiki` owns the wiki: `src/entry.server.ts` lists every page to prerender, `src/content.ts` reads the Markdown in `content/`, and `src/reference` builds catalog pages from `@quorum/simulation`. Islands in Markdown render views from `@quorum/ui`.
- `packages/rpc` owns the public wire contract only: Effect RPC groups, request/response schemas, declared errors, and the API path prefix.
- `packages/simulation` owns the Simulation: the catalog, the Game schema, the solver, the Step, actions, and the Sandboxes. A Node's lifecycle is one tagged state in `src/life.ts`, not separate fields ([ADR 0011](adr/0011-state-machines-are-for-flows.md)). The browser plays it and the API Worker will replay Challenges with it ([ADR 0004](adr/0004-simulation-package.md)). It imports only `effect` and its own files, and uses only exact math, so every runtime computes the same Game.
- `packages/ui` (`@quorum/ui`) owns the design language and the views both apps show ([ADR 0010](adr/0010-ui-package.md)): the primitives under `src/primitives`, the Graphite theme in `src/theme.css` (each app imports it after Tailwind), the shared game views, number formats, and icons under `src/game`, and the Pixi board with its routing and compute worker under `src/board`. A view takes the data it shows, never an app's Model; the board takes a `BoardState` with a `translate` function and reports gestures and sounds through callbacks. It ships TypeScript source; each app's Vite build compiles it. `src/boundary.test.ts` checks its import rules.
- `packages/mcp-relay` is `quorum-mcp-relay`, the one package published to npm. Its CLI runs on the player's machine as an MCP server on stdio and as a WebSocket server on loopback, which the Quorum page connects to ([ADR 0007](adr/0007-agents-read-the-game-through-a-local-relay.md)). `src/tools.ts` and `src/protocol.ts` import nothing, so the web app imports them for the tool list and the wire messages.
- `examples/reference` shows a complete Query-to-RPC path in a separate website app. Run it with `pnpm dev:reference`, which uses the root Alchemy entrypoint with the `reference` stage; it is deliberately excluded from the default stack.

## Dependency direction

```text
apps/web ─────────► packages/rpc, packages/simulation, packages/ui
apps/backend ─────► packages/rpc, packages/simulation
apps/wiki ────────► packages/simulation, packages/ui
examples/reference ► packages/rpc
apps/web ─────────► packages/mcp-relay (tools, protocol only)
packages/rpc ─────► effect
packages/simulation ► effect
packages/mcp-relay ► ws
packages/ui ───────► packages/simulation, foldkit, @foldkit/ui, lucide, pixi.js
```

The web app must not import backend implementation modules. The wiki must not import either other app or `packages/rpc`. The RPC package must not import either app or the Simulation. The Simulation must not import either app, `packages/rpc`, or any UI, browser, or Cloudflare module. The relay must not import either app, `packages/rpc`, or the Simulation. The UI package must not import an app or `packages/rpc`, and its primitives must not import its game views, its board, or the Simulation. Share the wire contract, not internal backend models.

## Cloudflare scope

The stack provisions the website Worker, the API Worker, and one D1 database, `Results`, bound to the API Worker as `RESULTS`. Challenges need it: the API Worker re-runs each submitted replay and keeps every device's best per axis, and histograms and percentiles are SQL counts over those rows. KV cannot count, and a Durable Object per Challenge would need hand-written aggregation. The schema is in `apps/backend/migrations`, which Alchemy applies on deploy.

The Challenges context sees only the `ResultStore` service (`apps/backend/src/contexts/challenges/store.ts`). `apps/backend/src/platform/d1-result-store.ts` implements it with SQL against a small structural `SqlRunner`, which a `D1Database` satisfies; tests run the same SQL on `node:sqlite`. Add R2, Access, Durable Objects, or other Cloudflare services only when a product feature requires them.
