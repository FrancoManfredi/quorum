title: 13. Exit and Legacy
summary: The prestige layer: Exits, Legacy, Ventures, and Mutators.
section: design

---

The prestige layer. A company ends in an **Exit**. The Exit pays **Legacy**. Legacy buys permanent
perks and opens new **Ventures**, which change the rules of the next company. This follows the idle
game prestige pattern ([Influences](/design/02-influences#idle-game-theory)), and it uses Ventures and
Mutators to keep each company different, which answers the Upload Labs complaint about repetition.

## Exits

| Exit        | Available from    | Payout basis                  | Multiplier                  | Notes                                                   |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Acqui-hire  | Series A          | Equity × min(valuation, $50M) | 0.5                         | Ends early. Good for a fast restart with a new Venture. |
| Acquisition | Series B          | Equity × valuation            | 1.0                         | The buyer pays the current valuation.                   |
| IPO         | Pre-IPO checklist | Equity × valuation at listing | 1.5                         | Continues into the Public Era.                          |
| Step down   | Public            | Equity × current market value | 1.5, + quarter streak bonus | Ends the company from the Public Era.                   |

```text
payout = equity × valuation × exit_multiplier
legacy = floor( sqrt( payout / $1,000,000 ) )
```

| Payout       | Legacy |
| ------------ | ------ |
| $1 million   | 1      |
| $100 million | 10     |
| $1 billion   | 31     |
| $10 billion  | 100    |
| $100 billion | 316    |

The square root follows the common prestige curve: each Exit is worth more than the last, but not
exponentially more, so the player keeps a reason to improve rather than repeat
([Balancing](/design/16-balancing#prestige-curve)).

**What resets.** Cash, Insight, Dev Hours, users, research, the board, the team, and Equity.

**What stays.** Legacy, Legacy shop purchases, Playbooks, achievements, Challenge results, unlocked
Ventures and Mutators, and the engineering glossary entries the player has discovered.

## The Legacy shop

The eleven perks cost 1,133 ★ in all, and costs grow so that a full shop takes several Exits, which
is the target for 80 to 150 hours.

## Playbooks

A **Playbook** is a saved sub-design: Nodes, links, Stacks, and settings. It is Quorum's version of
Factorio blueprints ([Influences](/design/02-influences#factorio)).

- The player saves a selection on the board as a Playbook.
- Placing a Playbook places all its Nodes in one action, if the player has the Cash and the research.
  Missing research shows as ghost Nodes.
- Playbooks survive Exits. The second company's first hour is faster because the player places a
  known-good Garage design in one action.
- Playbooks export as a text string, so players can share them.

Playbooks remove the post-prestige tedium that Upload Labs players report
([Influences](/design/02-influences#why-players-quit)).

## Ventures

A **Venture** is the kind of company the player founds. Each Venture changes the request mix, demand
shape, constraints, and incidents. The default Venture is unlocked from the start. Others cost Legacy
or come from achievements.

No Venture constraint and no signature incident is built yet, apart from the Bootstrapped indie
Venture's no-funding rule.

Each Venture has its own Legacy multiplier (1.0× to 1.5×), shown before founding.

## Mutators

A **Mutator** is an optional rule that makes a company harder in exchange for more Legacy. Three
Mutators — Legacy monolith, One region forever, and Tight budget — open on the first Exit, and the
other six come from achievements ([Challenges](/design/14-challenges#achievements)). Each one adds a
Legacy multiplier.

| Mutator                 | Rule                                                                                      | Legacy |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Chaos Monkey            | Instance failures are four times as likely, from the Seed Era                             | +25%   |
| Hacker News front page  | Traffic spikes are three times as frequent                                                | +15%   |
| Legacy monolith         | Start with a large PHP codebase: migrations cost 3× and tech debt starts at 40%           | +20%   |
| One region forever      | Multi-region is disabled                                                                  | +20%   |
| No caches               | The Cache and CDN are disabled                                                            | +40%   |
| Shared tenancy          | Not built yet: noisy neighbors would put random CPU steal on every instance               | +10%   |
| Tight budget            | Funding grants are halved                                                                 | +20%   |
| Single language         | Every App Server must run PHP                                                             | +15%   |
| Postgres for everything | The Cache, the Wide-column Store, Distributed SQL and the Data Warehouse cannot be placed | +30%   |
| Strict SLO              | The SLO is one level higher in every Era                                                  | +20%   |

"Postgres for everything" is a real engineering argument. With this Mutator the game supports it:
Postgres can serve `q-search` with full-text search, `ai` lookups with pgvector, and queues with
`SKIP LOCKED`, each with a lower ceiling than the dedicated Component.

## Company history

Each Exit adds a row to the company history: the Company's name, Venture, Mutators, time played, peak users, Exit type,
payout, Legacy earned, final Stack mix, and a snapshot of the board. The history is a record of how
the player's engineering changed over time.
