Use this guide when you reach the Series C Era and users abroad are slow, or when you need to
survive a Region outage.

From Series C, users live in four regions: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and South
America. Each region grows or shrinks on its own Apdex, and
[Users and growth](/explanation/users-and-growth) covers why users leave so fast when it slips.
Every user still enters your home region at first, so a far user pays the round trip across the
ocean twice for each request.

## Find out who is slow

1. Select **Users** on the HUD to open **Why users leave**, and look for rows from far regions.
2. Select the **Users** Node and open **Requests**. Compare the mean latency of each kind with the
   figures before Series C.
3. Read the [Series C](/eras/series-c) page for each region's share of your users.

More capacity does not help, because the delay is distance, so serve users from a region near them.

## Open a second region

1. Research [Multiple regions](/research/multi-region), which needs
   [Multiple zones](/research/multi-az).
2. Find the region tabs at the top of the board. Closed regions show as **+ EU**, **+ APAC**, and
   **+ SA**.
3. Click the region with the most slow users. Its tooltip shows the price, and the game opens the
   region with a Users Node of its own.
4. Click the new tab to see that region's board.

## Send users to their region

1. Research [GeoDNS](/research/geo-dns). Without it, every user still enters the home Users Node.
   With it, each region's users enter their own Users Node, or the nearest one that is up.
2. On the new tab, place a Load Balancer and App Servers, and link the region's Users Node to them.
3. Select a Node and open its **Region** section to move it to another open region. A Node that
   moves restarts.

The Payment Provider, LLM API, Push Provider, Auth Provider, CDN, Analytics, and Payments serve
every region. Do not copy them.

## Decide where the data lives

An App Server abroad that calls the home Database pays a cross-region round trip on every query, so
pick one pattern for each data Node:

| Pattern                  | How                                                                                              | Tradeoff                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read locally, write home | Place a [Read Replica](/components/replica) in the new region. Link writes to the home Database. | Fast reads. Writes cross the ocean. Some reads come back stale. |
| Leaderless store         | [Wide-column Store](/components/wide) with **Regions** set to **Spread**.                        | Local quorums. Eventual consistency across regions.             |
| Consensus store          | [Distributed SQL](/components/dsql) with **Regions** set to **Spread**.                          | Correct everywhere. Slow writes. Much more Burn.                |

A spread store runs nodes in up to three regions and bills for each, so use Distributed SQL for
checkouts and a [leaderless store](/glossary/leaderless-replication) for feeds. See
[The data tier](/explanation/the-data-tier).

The [Missed Write](/sandboxes/missed-write) Sandbox asks every API read to see the latest write.

## Copy the Design with a Mirror

Building each region by hand is slow and drifts, so with
[Infrastructure as code](/research/infra-as-code) you mirror one region into another.

1. Click **Mirror** next to the region tabs.
2. Pick an IaC tool. Then, under "Mirror … into", pick the target region. Each button shows its
   price.
3. For each data Node, pick how the Mirror copies it: **Read replica**, **Own primary**,
   **Replicate**, or **Call source**.
4. Click **Apply**. The new Nodes serve after the apply time.
5. Later, a dot on a tab shows that the region has drifted from its source. Apply again, or keep the
   change as an override.

[GitOps](/research/gitops) syncs Mirrors on its own, all at once or **Staged**.

## Survive a Region outage

A [Region outage](/incidents/region) takes down every Node in one region, except global Components
and stores spread across enough regions.

1. Keep App Servers in at least two regions, with GeoDNS on.
2. Keep the data that the other region needs available there: a spread store, or a replica you can
   serve from.
3. Keep spare capacity in each region. The users of the failed region move to the nearest live one.

That choice is what sets your [RPO and RTO](/glossary/rpo-and-rto): how much data you can lose and
how long you take to serve again. Before the IPO, the DR drill fails your home region on purpose,
and [Prepare for an Exit](/guides/prepare-for-an-exit) covers that step.

## Cut the user hop

- [Anycast](/research/anycast) takes 20 ms off the user hop everywhere.
- [HTTP/3](/research/http3) cuts the hop to distant users by 20%.
- Calls between regions also cost [egress](/glossary/egress). Keep each region's App Servers
  calling their own data where you can.

Open **Why users leave** again: the far-region rows must shrink, and Apdex on the HUD must return to
its target.

The [Far Away](/sandboxes/far-away) Sandbox puts half your users outside North America. Get API
reads under its limit on average.
