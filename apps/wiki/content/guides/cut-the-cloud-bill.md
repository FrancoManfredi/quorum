Use this guide when Burn is close to income, your runway is short, or you want a better margin
before an Exit.

[Burn](/explanation/money) is the Cash you spend per second. It adds up every Node's price, your
salaries, egress, and third-party fees. Every cut in this guide has a cost in capacity or risk, so
make one change at a time and check Apdex after each one.

## Read the bill

1. Look at the **Cash** figure on the HUD. The line under it is your net income per second. A
   negative value means that Burn is larger than income.
2. Select the **Payments** Node. The Inspector opens.
3. Read the **Revenue**, **Burn**, and **Salaries** rows. Salaries are part of Burn.
4. Press **D** to open the Dashboard, once you own [Metrics](/research/metrics). The **Revenue
   and Burn** chart shows when the gap opened. A blue line marks each change you made.

If salaries are most of the Burn, the board is not your problem. Hire fewer engineers, or wait
until revenue grows. See [Team and velocity](/explanation/team-and-velocity).

## Find the expensive Nodes

5. Select each Node in turn. Every Node card in the Inspector has a **Burn** row.
6. Compare the Burn row with the **Load** row of the same Node.
7. Mark each Node that costs much and runs under 50% load. These are your first cuts.

A Node with a **Standby** costs twice its Burn. A Database with **Backups** costs more than one
without. Both are deliberate insurance, so remove them only if you accept the risk.

## Remove idle capacity

8. For an idle sized Node, open the **Instance** section and select **Smaller (free)**.
9. Wait a few seconds of game time. Check that Load stays under 70%.
10. If you have two copies of a Node and both run cool, sell one. Select it and click the trash
    button. The refund is half of what the last copy cost.

If the Node goes amber or red after the change, select **Undo** (Z) at once.

:::Note{tone="warn"}
A resize restarts the Node for a short time. A single Node with no second copy drops its traffic
while it restarts.

## Pick a cheaper family

11. Open the **Instance** section of an App Server, Worker, or Database.
12. Read the gauges in **Resources** before you change anything.
13. Pick a family that matches the full gauge:
    - **Compute** costs 0.85 times General per vCPU and has half the RAM. Use it when CPU is the
      limit and RAM has room.
    - **Burstable** costs 0.4 times General. It runs on CPU credits and drops to a fraction of its
      CPU when they run out. Use it only for a Node that is idle most of the time.
    - **Memory** costs 1.3 times General. It is not a cut, but a Database whose working set does
      not fit in RAM can serve more on a smaller Memory box.
14. Watch the **CPU credits** gauge on a Burstable Node. If it falls toward zero, go back to
    General.

## Lower egress

From the Seed Era, every byte that an App Server sends to the internet costs
[egress](/glossary/egress). Media and page views send the most.

15. Research [Compression](/research/gzip). Then open the **Compression** section of each App
    Server and select **Gzip**. Page and read responses get smaller for a little more CPU.
16. Research [Content delivery](/research/cdn) and place a [CDN](/components/cdn) in front of the
    App Servers. Pages that the CDN answers at the edge cost $0.02 per GB, against $0.09 per GB
    from an App Server.
17. Keep Nodes that call each other in the same zone. A call between zones pays egress both ways.

## Let capacity follow demand

Traffic follows a daily cycle. A fleet sized for the evening peak is idle at night.

18. Research [Autoscaling](/research/autoscaling) and place an [Autoscaler](/components/autoscaler).
19. Link the App Servers into it.
20. In **Scaling**, set a low **min** and a **max** that covers the peak. The Autoscaler removes
    copies when the load falls well under the target.
21. Later, research [Container orchestration](/research/containers). App Servers linked into a
    [Kubernetes Cluster](/components/cluster) pack onto shared nodes and cost 0.85 times their
    Burn. Each Cluster also takes Dev Hours until you have a Platform team.

## Trim the smaller lines

- **Analytics.** A higher **Sample rate** earns more Insight and costs more storage Burn. Lower
  it once you have the Research you need.
- **Auth Provider.** It charges per user. At very large user counts, compare its Burn row with
  the App Server CPU it saves.
- **Search Engine, Cache, Queue.** Each size step doubles capacity and Burn. Size them up only
  when their Load passes 70%.

## Check the result

22. Look at the Cash line on the HUD. It must move up.
23. Check that Apdex stays at or above its target. A cut that loses users loses more revenue than
    it saves.
24. Open the Dashboard. The Burn line on **Revenue and Burn** must fall and stay down through the
    next evening peak.

## Practice

The [Out of Credits](/sandboxes/out-of-credits) Sandbox ends with a Burn limit at night traffic.
The [Read Mostly](/sandboxes/read-mostly) Sandbox doubles the demand and sets a Burn limit.
