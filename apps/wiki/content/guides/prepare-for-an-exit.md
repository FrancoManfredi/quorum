Use this guide when the **Exit** button appears on the toolbar and you want to get the most
[Legacy](/prestige) out of this Company. If it is your first time,
[Your first Exit](/tutorials/first-exit) walks through one Exit step by step.

An Exit ends the Company and pays Legacy. Legacy grows with the square root of your payout, so a
payout four times as large gives twice the Legacy. The payout is your Equity times the valuation
times the Exit's multiplier. See [Why a Company ends](/explanation/legacy).

## Know your options

The Exit panel lists the Exits you can take now, and [Exits](/prestige#exits) has the full rules:

| Exit        | Offered from                                 | Multiplier                                              |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Acqui-hire  | [Series A](/eras/series-a)                   | 0.5, on a valuation of at most $50M                     |
| Acquisition | [Series B](/eras/series-b)                   | 1.0                                                     |
| IPO         | [Pre-IPO](/eras/pre-ipo), with the checklist | 1.5. The Company goes on into the Public Era.           |
| Step down   | [Public](/eras/public)                       | 1.5, plus 0.1 per quarter in your beat streak, up to +1 |

## Read the offer

1. Click **Exit** on the toolbar. Its badge shows the most Legacy an offer pays now.
2. Read the four figures at the top: **Valuation**, **Rule of 40**, **Equity**, and **Legacy ×**.
3. Read each offer's payout and its **Take** button, which shows the Legacy it pays.

If you do not take an offer, nothing happens: the offers stay and change with your valuation.

## Raise the valuation

The valuation is your yearly revenue times a multiple, and the multiple grows with your
[Rule of 40](/glossary/rule-of-40) score: user growth plus profit margin, in percent.

1. **Grow revenue.** Every point of Apdex below target loses users, so fix the bottleneck first, and
   [Find the bottleneck](/guides/find-the-bottleneck) covers the loop.
2. **Raise the margin.** Margin is income minus Burn, over income, so
   [Cut the cloud bill](/guides/cut-the-cloud-bill) is the other lever.
3. **Keep users growing.** Growth counts over the last calendar week, so a recent loss of users
   lowers the score.
4. **Research [Investor relations](/research/investor-relations)** in the Pre-IPO Era. It adds 2
   to the multiple.
5. Open the Exit panel again and compare the **Valuation** figure.

The multiple has a floor and a ceiling, so past a point a higher Rule of 40 adds nothing.

## Protect your Equity

Each funding round you raise lowers your Equity, and the payout uses your Equity, so declining keeps
more of the Exit, though it also slows growth in the next [Era](/explanation/progression). Weigh the
two at each offer. See [Cash, Burn, and funding](/explanation/money).

## Pick the Exit

1. Take **Acqui-hire** only for a fast restart, for example to try a new Venture. It pays half, on
   a capped valuation.
2. Take **Acquisition** when you reach Series B and do not plan to reach the IPO.
3. Aim for the **IPO** for the best multiplier, because it pays at listing and the Company goes on.
   **Step down** later pays only for what the Company grew since the IPO.

## Prepare for the IPO checklist

In the Pre-IPO Era, the HUD shows the IPO checklist. Every item must hold at once:

- **Users**: reach the Era's target.
- **Reliability**: availability this week at or above the SLO.
- **SOC 2**: research [SOC 2 program](/research/soc2) and [Security team](/research/security-team).
- **DR drill**: research [Disaster recovery drills](/research/dr-drills) and click **Run DR drill**.
  The drill fails your home region. Serve users from another region within an hour, and lose
  less than five minutes of writes.
- **Data residency**: research [Data residency controls](/research/gdpr-residency) and serve EU
  users from EU data. See [Go global](/guides/go-global).
- **Rule of 40**: a score of 40 or more.

When every item is met at once, the **IPO** button appears on the HUD, and the IPO cannot be
declined.

## Take the Exit

1. Click **Take** on the offer you chose.
2. If you own [Institutional knowledge](/prestige#perks), pick the Research to keep under **Keep
   research**.
3. Click **Legacy shop** to spend your Legacy, or **Next company** to start again.

Cash, users, the board, Research, the Team, and Equity reset. Legacy, perks, Playbooks, and
achievements stay. Save a Playbook of your best sub-design before you exit, because it makes the
next Company start faster.

The Exit screen then shows **+N Legacy** and the payout, so compare it with the badge you read on
the **Exit** button. The Legacy shop shows your new balance.
