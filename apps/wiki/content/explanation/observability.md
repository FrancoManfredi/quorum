You start Quorum almost blind, like a real early startup. You see load bars, request rates, a mean
latency, and one error number. Observability does two jobs in the game. It produces Insight, the
currency that buys Research. And observability Research decides how much of your system you can see.

## Analytics samples your traffic

The [Analytics](/components/analytics) Node is a tap. Link any Node into it, and it samples that
Node's traffic. Each sample has a request kind, and it adds Insight to that kind's pool. Failed and
frustrated requests also add to the Failure pool. [Eras and Research](/explanation/progression)
explains why Insight comes in kinds.

The yield follows a square root:

```formula
Insight(kind) = Σ over Component types: √(sampled requests of that kind per second)
Failure       = 3 × Σ over Component types: √(sampled failed requests per second)
```

Two rules follow from it:

- **Breadth beats size.** Four times the traffic gives only twice the Insight. But each Component
  type adds its own term. A read sampled at the Load Balancer, the App Server, the Cache, and the
  Database teaches four times as much as a read sampled at one Node.
- **Copies do not count twice.** Ten App Servers make one term. Splitting a Node into many teaches
  nothing new.

The Failure pool earns three times as much per sample, because a healthy Design fails rarely. A
request that fails or frustrates its user counts fully, and a tolerated one counts in part. Failing on
purpose is still a bad trade: failures cost users, revenue, and error budget.

## Seeing costs something

Analytics has a capacity in samples per second, and each size step doubles it. Samples past it are
dropped evenly. You choose the sample rate: 1%, 5%, 10% (the default), 50%, or 100%.

A higher rate gives more Insight, but not in proportion: 100% gives about three times the Insight of
10%. It also costs:

- **CPU** on every tapped Node.
- **Latency** on every tapped hop, which can lower Apdex.
- **Storage Burn** on the Analytics bill.

Analytics also keeps traces for a retention window: 15 minutes, 1 hour, or 6 hours of sim time. A
longer window costs more storage, and it lets each Insight pool hold more. A pool holds about one
window's worth of Insight at your current rate, so you cannot save up a huge balance and buy a whole
Era when it opens.

:::Note{tone="real"}
Observability bills surprise real teams too. Sampling is how real tracing systems keep that cost
down: they keep a share of requests and accept that rare events may be missed.

## The visibility ladder

The Simulation always computes every number in the Ledger. Research changes what the interface
shows, not what happens. A player without [Percentiles](/research/percentiles) still loses revenue to
slow requests. They just cannot see the p99.

Each step of the [Observability track](/research) shows you more:

| Research                                   | What you can now see                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Structured logs](/research/logs)          | Errors split by cause, such as `stranded`, `dropped`, `refused`, `down`, and `oom`. |
| [Metrics](/research/metrics)               | History graphs on every Node, and the Dashboard.                                    |
| [Percentiles](/research/percentiles)       | p50, p95, and p99 next to the mean.                                                 |
| [Alerting](/research/alerting)             | A pager banner when errors, p99, or saturation cross a threshold.                   |
| [SLO dashboards](/research/slo-dashboards) | The error budget on the HUD, and its burn rate on the Dashboard.                    |

[Distributed tracing](/research/tracing) is on the track, and other items require it. It promises
each kind's time Node by Node, but it does not change what you see in the game yet.

## Two tools that are always on

The **bottleneck marker** is always visible. It names the Node whose extra capacity would earn the
most. It keeps the game playable before you can see anything else.

The **Churn breakdown** is always available too. It opens from the Users figure and lists the rows
that cost each region its Apdex, by request kind and cause. Research adds detail: with Structured
logs, a failure names its cause, and with Percentiles, a slow row shows its p99.
[Users and growth](/explanation/users-and-growth) explains how to read it.

## Alerts and alert fatigue

With Alerting, three default rules watch your system:

- The error rate stays above 1% for 30 seconds.
- A kind's p99 stays above 4 times its Apdex target for 30 seconds.
- A Node stays above 90% utilization for 60 seconds.

You can make each rule more or less sensitive. An alert that fires with no incident behind it is a
false alarm. After 5 false alarms in one calendar day, the game marks the rule as ignored, and it
stops paging you. This is alert fatigue, and it is real: a team that is paged for nothing stops
looking. Tune a noisy rule instead of living with it.

## The Dashboard

The Board shows your system now. The Dashboard, which opens with `D` after Metrics, shows it over
time. Its first rows chart the [four golden signals](/glossary/four-golden-signals): traffic,
latency, errors, and saturation. Lines on the charts mark your recent Design changes and the start of
an incident, so you can check that a line moved after your fix and not before it. See
[annotation](/glossary/annotation).

Long ranges show averaged blocks of time. The p99 line draws the worst minute in each block instead,
because an average would hide the spike. See [downsampling](/glossary/downsampling) and
[Read p99](/guides/read-p99).
