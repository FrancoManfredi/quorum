Quorum tries to teach real systems engineering through play. Every rule has to be true enough that
what you learn in the game helps you at work. It also has to run ten times a second in a browser tab,
and it has to be fun. This page says where the game holds close to reality and where it bends it.

## The design rule: real shape, simple math

The Simulation does not run real servers, a real Kubernetes, or real network packets. It computes
rates. Each Step, it walks your Design from the Users outward and works out what arrives at each
Node, what it can serve, what waits, and what fails. The result is the Ledger: every number the game
shows. [How requests flow](/explanation/requests) describes this walk.

The goal is that the curves have the shape of real systems. Latency rises sharply near full
utilization. Tails grow with fan-out. Retries make overload worse. The exact numbers are stylized so
that they stay cheap to compute and easy to read.

:::Note{tone="real"}
The designers considered driving a faithful Kubernetes simulation and rejected it. It would not
model the numbers you optimize, such as latency and revenue, and it is too heavy for a browser game.
So Kubernetes is a Component with modeled behavior, not a simulated cluster.

## What the game models faithfully

These rules follow the real formula or the real behavior closely:

- **Little's law.** Requests in flight equal throughput times the time each one stays. This is exact,
  and it is why a slow Database fills the slots of the App Servers that call it. See
  [Little's law](/glossary/littles-law).
- **The utilization curve.** Waiting grows with ρ / (1 − ρ), the shape of a single-server queue.
  Real servers have many workers, but the hockey stick is the same. See
  [Capacity, utilization, and queues](/explanation/queues).
- **Apdex.** The game uses the standard Apdex formula: satisfied requests count fully, tolerating
  ones as half. See [Apdex and revenue](/explanation/apdex-and-revenue).
- **Tail amplification.** When a request fans out, the slowest call decides its latency. This
  follows Dean and Barroso's "The Tail at Scale".
- **Metastable failure.** Retries can keep a system overloaded after the trigger is gone. The Retry
  storm incident ends only when the backlog drains. See [Errors and retries](/explanation/errors-and-retries).
- **Runtime behavior.** One event loop stalls every request when one request burns CPU. A worker
  pool holds a slot while the request waits. PHP frees memory after every request, so it cannot leak
  across them. See the [Runtimes](/runtimes) pages.
- **Error budgets** follow the Google SRE policy, and **dilution** per round follows Carta's
  published medians.
- **User growth and churn.** Growth follows the classic word-of-mouth diffusion curve, and the
  least loyal users leave first, as retention studies show. See
  [Users and growth](/explanation/users-and-growth).

## Simplifications made on purpose

These rules bend reality so the game is playable. Each one keeps the lesson and changes the scale.

**Time runs fast.** One sim second is one calendar minute, so a calendar day passes in 24 real
minutes at 1× speed. The Team's calendar runs faster still: a Team day lasts one real minute, so hires
and deploys happen in a session.

**Users are impatient.** Real users drift away over weeks when a site gets slow. In Quorum, they
leave within minutes when Apdex falls under the target, so you can feel the effect and fix it. They
also stop leaving as soon as you fix it, with no lasting grudge.

**Overload drops at once.** A real server builds a backlog when it is over capacity. The game drops
work past capacity at once instead, which keeps each Step independent of the last. Queues are the
exception: a [Queue](/components/queue) stores its depth.

**Latency settles in passes.** Latency and capacity depend on each other: a slow Database fills the
App Servers that wait on it. The Simulation settles this circle with a few damped passes each Step,
not with an exact solution.

**Prices map two ways.** Prices billed by time map one sim second to one real hour: a vCPU costs
what one costs per hour. Prices billed by use, such as egress, keep the real list price. The two do
not agree with each other, on purpose: at the time-billed rate, egress would eat half of every page
view's value. Request values, the cost index, and the salary index are balance controls, not real
prices. Revenue is in game dollars, and the Valuation scales it to real-dollar ARR. See
[Cash, Burn, and funding](/explanation/money).

**A Company never dies.** No incident ends a Company, and running out of Cash is a setback, not a
game over. Users never fall below a small floor. While you are away, no incident starts, and each
region keeps at least 95% of its users. This is a design choice, not a claim about real startups.

**Regions are tabs over one Design.** Each Node has a region, and a call between regions pays the
round trip between them, based on the speed of light in fiber. The board shows one tab per region,
but the Simulation solves one graph.

## Deterministic on purpose

Real systems are noisy. Quorum is exactly repeatable: the same save, the same seed, and the same
actions give the same result in every browser. All randomness, such as incident timing, comes from
one seeded generator in the save.

To guarantee this, the Simulation uses only math that every JavaScript engine computes the same way:
add, subtract, multiply, divide, and square root. It never calls functions such as `sin` or `exp`,
which engines compute slightly differently. Smooth curves such as the daily demand cycle are built
from those exact operations. This lets the server replay a Challenge and check its score.

## Not modeled yet

The design describes some systems that the game does not have yet. The glossary marks each one.

- **One Service.** The Company runs one codebase, the monolith. Service splits and the coordination
  cost of a shared database are designed but not built. See [Conway's law](/glossary/conways-law).
- **Feature Flags.** A Feature reaches every user at its deploy, with no gradual rollout. See
  [feature flag](/glossary/feature-flag).
- **Spot instances.** Spot pricing is designed but not in the game. See
  [spot instance](/glossary/spot-instance).
- **Distributed tracing.** The Research exists, but it does not change what you see yet. See
  [distributed tracing](/glossary/distributed-tracing).

The game's design documents keep a reality check: a table of every claim the game makes, the rule
that models it, the simplification, and the source. The wiki's [glossary](/glossary) gives the real
meaning of each term and what it does in the game, side by side.
