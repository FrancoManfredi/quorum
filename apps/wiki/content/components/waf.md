The WAF stands for a web application firewall such as ModSecurity with the OWASP Core Rule Set.

## When to place it

- Place it when bots take a large share of your traffic and load your App Servers, or when logins spike from bots. It unlocks with [Web application firewall](/research/waf).
- Turn on Under attack mode only while a DDoS lasts.

The [Bots](/sandboxes/bots) Sandbox shows the symptom.

::Sandbox{id="bots"}

## How it works

Place it in front of your App Servers. It takes every request kind and sends on what it lets through. It blocks a share of bots, and a smaller share of real users with them. Blocked users fail as `blocked`. See [WAF](/glossary/waf-web-application-firewall).

Each size step doubles its capacity. It spans every zone.

## Options

- **Paranoia level:** sets the tradeoff. A higher level blocks more bots, blocks more real users, and costs more CPU per request, so the WAF handles less traffic.
- **Under attack mode:** challenges every request. It blocks nearly all junk, blocks some real users, and adds latency.

## How it fails

- Overloaded, it drops requests before they reach the App Servers. A high paranoia level makes this happen sooner.
- A high level blocks real users and costs revenue.
- [Regex backtracking](/incidents/regex): a new rule backtracks on long inputs, and every WAF runs out of CPU. Disable the rule to end it. See [ReDoS](/glossary/redos-regular-expression-denial-of-service).

Without a WAF, [Bot surge](/incidents/bot-surge), [Credential stuffing](/incidents/stuffing), and [DDoS](/incidents/ddos) hit harder and more often.

## Tips

- Start at the default level and raise it only when bots still get through.
- Turn Under attack mode off when the DDoS ends.
