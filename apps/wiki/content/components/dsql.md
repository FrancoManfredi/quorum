Distributed SQL keeps transactions correct across regions, as CockroachDB does on [Raft](/glossary/raft) consensus.

## When to place it

- Place it when your Company runs in several regions and checkouts must stay correct everywhere. It unlocks with [Consensus databases](/research/consensus). See [Go global](/guides/go-global).
- Skip it for traffic that a [Database](/components/database) or [Wide-column Store](/components/wide) can serve. It is the most expensive data Component, the right store for checkouts and an expensive one for feeds.

## How it works

It takes read queries, write queries, and transactions, and it sends nothing on. Its capacity is counted in transactions, and a read costs a fraction of a transaction. Each size step doubles its capacity.

Every write waits for a majority of its replicas. In one region that costs a few milliseconds. Spread across regions, a write waits for a cross-region round trip, so write latency rises. Reads stay local. When spread, its Burn grows with each region.

## How it fails

- Spread across regions, every write pays the round trip. Write-heavy kinds feel it in p99.
- Overloaded, it drops queries like any data Node.

It also prevents failures:

- [Region outage](/incidents/region): spread across three regions, it survives with no data loss, because a majority remains.
- [Network partition](/incidents/partition): a consensus store keeps one leader, so writes do not diverge. Fence the old leader to end the incident. See [network partition](/glossary/network-partition).

:::Note{tone="real"}
Consensus trades latency for correctness. Real teams use it for money and keep cheaper stores for the rest.

## Tips

- Open a third region before you count on it to survive a region outage.
