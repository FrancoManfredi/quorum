The Kubernetes Cluster packs your services onto shared machines, as Kubernetes does.

## When to place it

- Place it when you run many App Servers and Workers, and Burn or scaling speed matters more than simplicity. It unlocks with [Container orchestration](/research/containers).

## How it works

It takes no traffic. Link App Servers or Workers into it and they run as pods. Pods pack onto shared nodes, so they cost less Burn for the same capacity. An [Autoscaler](/components/autoscaler) adds pods in seconds instead of booting VMs for minutes. See [container orchestration](/glossary/container-orchestration).

It also brings:

- **Rolling deploys**: a bad deploy stops after its first batch of pods, so only part of the traffic fails.
- **Self-healing**: when a pod's host dies, the Cluster reschedules it.

The costs:

- **Noisy neighbours**: pods share CPU, and busy neighbours add delay to a share of requests.
- **Platform work**: without a Platform team, each Cluster takes Dev Hours from your product teams. See [Team and velocity](/explanation/team-and-velocity).
- **Upgrades**: each Kubernetes version is supported for a limited time.

## How it fails

- [Forced cluster upgrade](/incidents/cluster-upgrade): the provider upgrades a Cluster off an unsupported version, and pods that used removed APIs crash. Run the "Upgrade clusters" task each quarter, or staff a Platform team. See [Team tasks](/team#tasks).
- If the Cluster goes down, its pods run as plain VMs again, with full Burn and slow scaling.
- Noisy neighbours raise p99 when the shared nodes run busy.

## Tips

- Use one Cluster for many services. It costs less platform time than several Clusters.
- Pair a Cluster with an Autoscaler. Fast pod scaling is most of its value.
