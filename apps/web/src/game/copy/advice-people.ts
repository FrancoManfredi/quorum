Three partners screenshotted your Board this morning and one of them cried a little.\n\nWe lead rounds, and we would like to lead your ${round}. Would love to grab coffee, or a call, or a walk, whichever moves fastest.\n\nIf you are ready, hit Raise. If the timing is wrong, Decline, and we will pretend to be fine about it.\n\nWarmly,\nA partner at ${from}`,

We have watched many Boards come and go, and yours has the quiet look of something that will still be running when our grandchildren's funds are raising.\n\nWe would be honoured to lead your ${round} round. Patient capital, aligned incentives, and a board seat we promise to use sparingly.\n\nShould you wish to proceed, choose Raise. Should you not, Decline, and we shall wait. We are very good at waiting.\n\nWith respect,\nThe partners of ${from}`,

Decline if you would rather keep building on instant noodles. Both are fine. One is faster.\n\n${from}`,

We are founder-friendly, operator-led, thesis-driven, and every other hyphenated word on our website.\n\nNo pressure. (Some pressure.) Raise, and the paperwork lands before you finish your coffee. Decline, and we will circle back next quarter, as is tradition.\n\nCheers,\nThe ${from} team\n\nP.S. Loved your last commit message.`,

You have enough Insight to research something.\n\nOpen Research and spend your Insight. Pick the thing that bit you most recently. It will bite less.\n\nWarmly,\n${from}\n\nP.S.

      body: `Hello again,\n\nI was asked once what separates a company that goes public from one that merely wants to. My answer then, and now: the boring part.\n\nThe exciting part is the user count. Grow to ${users} users. The boring part is the IPO checklist, and you must clear all of it. Founders who skip the boring part become case studies, and I have taught enough of those.\n\nDo both, and you can go public.\n\nFondly,\n${from}`,

Grow to ${users} users and clear the IPO checklist to go public. The first proves people want it. The second proves you can be trusted with it.\n\nI am proud of how far you have come. Do not tell anyone I said so.\n\n${from}`,
