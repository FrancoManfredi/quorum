Queueing delay grows as ρ / (1 − ρ), the Node warns at 70% and shows danger at 90%, and above 100% it drops the excess. The Bottleneck search weighs only Nodes above 60%, and an Autoscaler targets 40%, 60%, or 80%. The Saturation row on the Dashboard shows each Node as a gauge and as a 24-hour timeline, with the same 70% and 90% lines.',

      'Resizing a sized Node moves it one step between nano (0.5 vCPU) and metal (96 vCPU), and each step doubles vCPU and RAM, but the Node restarts and comes back cold. Some software cannot use the extra cores: Node.js runs one event loop on one core, and Redis answers on one thread. To scale out, put more App Servers behind DNS or a Load Balancer, each copy costing 25% more to place, or let an Autoscaler add copies, which take 180 s on VMs or 30 s in a Kubernetes Cluster. The instance family also matters: ARM instances research adds a family with General’s vCPU and RAM for 0.8× the price, which runs at 0.95× the CPU speed (proposed).',
