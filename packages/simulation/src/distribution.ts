/* ==========================================================================
   What happens to one request on its way through the Design. An Outcome is a
   success share, a latency distribution, and the share that fails by cause.

   Latency is a fixed part (base latencies, network hops) plus an exponential
   part (service and queueing), plus a rare tail event such as an event loop
   stall. The tail lands on the slowest `tailP` share of requests: they are the
   ones that waited behind the stall. Exponential response times are the M/M/1 shape, so percentiles and
   Apdex fall out of one formula. The math uses only + − × ÷, so it is exact
   across JavaScript engines.
