/* ==========================================================================
   Public quarters (10 "Era 7"). A quarter is 7 calendar days. The player sets
   guidance on its first day; at its end the market compares revenue growth and
   margin with it. A beat raises the multiple, a miss lowers it, and every
   fourth beat in a row adds a bonus. The GDD gives no magnitudes: these are
   set here and listed in 16's balance tables.
