 * beat 0.6 × the Balanced lower bound (27 min), Stubborn must reach Seed within
 * 1.6 × 60 min and within 1.6 × Balanced on the same seed, Decliner must reach
 * Seed, and Polyglot, who migrates to every language it researches, must be no
 * more than 30% faster than Balanced. The design's targets run to IPO; the slice
