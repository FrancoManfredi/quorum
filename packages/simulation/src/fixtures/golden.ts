// SIM_VERSION 2 (M4): the founder now builds Features with Dev Hours and each
// deploy rolls for a bad deploy, so the Pre-seed replay's demand and seed move.
// SIM_VERSION 3 (M5 Seed): the save gains Queue depth, Cache, Queue and WAF
// options, and stored GB. The Pre-seed replay's values are unchanged; the
// encoded Game carries the new fields, so its hash moves.
// SIM_VERSION 4 (M5 Series A): the save gains each Node's zone, standby, copies
// and Autoscaler settings, the incident's zone, and the error budget. The
// Pre-seed replay's values are unchanged; the encoded Game carries the new
// fields, so its hash moves.
// SIM_VERSION 5 (M5 Series B): the save gains each Node's GPU type, collector,
// GOGC, load shedding and read-your-writes, and each Link's breaker, open time
// and failure share. The Pre-seed replay's values are unchanged; the encoded
// Game carries the new fields, so its hash moves.
// SIM_VERSION 6 (M6): the save gains each Node's region, quorum settings, lost
// replica, spread, backups, fan-out and key splitting, the incident's region,
// users in each SLO hour, the DR drill and the Public quarter. The replay's values
// are unchanged again; only the new fields move the hash.
// SIM_VERSION 7 (M7): the save gains the founding (Venture, Mutators, perks),
// banked Legacy, peak users, and the wall clock of the last save. The replay's
// values are unchanged: with the new fields removed it still hashes to aed6bacd.
// SIM_VERSION 8: one Dev Hour is one engineer-hour, made 8 per calendar day on
// the Team's calendar, and Features have real sizes and requirements, so the
// founder's backlog builds at a new pace.
// SIM_VERSION 9: prices follow real list prices, requests earn half as much, and
// the cost and salary index rise from Seed (16 "Cost index").
// SIM_VERSION 10: Insight has a pool per request kind and a Failure pool, grows
// with the square root of samples per Component type, and research runs as
// Studies that take Insight over time; sampling adds CPU and latency.
// SIM_VERSION 11: a CVE is disclosed every few minutes as a patch ticket with a
// deadline; an overdue one is exploited and starts a Data breach. The save gains
// the disclosed CVEs, and a backlog item gains its deadline.
// SIM_VERSION 12: Split the Box asks for p99 under 300 ms, and the daily drill's
// boards serve their users until the incident. The Company replay is unchanged.
// SIM_VERSION 13: all 32 Challenges. A Challenge board can set its request mix,
// what each kind earns, regional daily cycles, and fixes paid in Dev Hours; a run
// takes incident responses, and a coarse Step runs second by second while
// something fails. A Tomcat box holding realtime connections refuses work at its
// RAM instead of swapping, and a store spread across regions survives a zone.
// The Company replay is unchanged.
// SIM_VERSION 14: async work is scored on when it finishes, a Queue has a max
// length and max attempts, a Worker prefetches and runs its own Queue's task mix,
// a full backlog is offered only as fast as Workers take it, and Kubernetes
// Clusters cost Dev Hours, roll deploys, reschedule pods and need upgrades. The
// save gains each Node's attempts, max length, prefetch and upgrade time, and each
// team's kind.
// SIM_VERSION 15: from Series C each region counts its own Users, grows and
// churns on its own users' Apdex, word of mouth crosses borders, and the raise
// into Series C keeps every user at home with a seed abroad. Half of new users
// are fickle and half steady; steady users leave at a fifth of the rate. The
// save gains each region's share of the users, its steady share, and its Apdex.
// SIM_VERSION 17: a Node's lifecycle is one tagged state (`life`) instead of the
// `down`, `warm` and `downCause` fields. Old saves derive it when they decode.
// SIM_VERSION 18: the save gains each Node's pricing model and the sim time a
// reserved term ends. The replay's values are unchanged; the encoded Game carries
// the new fields, so its hash and every Challenge's move.
// SIM_VERSION 19: the API Gateway is a Component, and the save gains each Node's
// rate limit. A Gateway throttles past its limit and bills per request on a new
// Requests line of the cloud bill. The replay's values are unchanged; the new
// field moves the hash.
// SIM_VERSION 20: the Realtime Hub is a Component, and the save gains each Node's
// Presence, reconnect backoff and Clustering. A Hub holds a connection for every
// realtime message instead of serving it as a request, and a revenue multiplier
// now reaches the user through every hop it answers behind. The replay's values
// are unchanged; the new fields move the hash.
// SIM_VERSION 21: the CI/CD Pipeline is a Component, and the save gains each Node's
// deploy strategy (Recreate, Rolling, Blue-green or Canary). A Pipeline sets how long
// a deploy takes, what it burns, and the ceiling on a bad deploy's blast radius. The
// replay's values are unchanged; the new field moves the hash.
// SIM_VERSION 22: the data tier gains its options. A Database has an engine (Postgres
// or MySQL), a volume (general purpose or provisioned IOPS) and shards; Object Storage
// has a class. Writes wait on the volume's IOPS, MySQL holds more connections, shards
// divide the writes, and an archive-class read fails. The replay's values move where a
// volume or a shard count binds; the new fields move every hash either way.
