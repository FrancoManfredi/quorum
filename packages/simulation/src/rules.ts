   What each Component does in the flow solve, one rule per Component. The
   solve walks the graph, splits traffic, repeats its passes, and builds the
   Ledger; a rule answers the questions that depend on the Component:

   - `model`: its capacity and latency for the work that reaches it.
   - `serve`: what it sends on for the work it processed.
   - `outcome`: what one request of a kind gets back from it.
   - `connections`: the database connections it opens to each data Node it calls.
   - `probe`: the work it is weighed with, for a Load Balancer's split.

   The table is a Record over every ComponentId, so a new Component cannot
   compile until it answers each one.
