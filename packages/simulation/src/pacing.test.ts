 * 11 minutes and Seed at 27–36. The measured times are in 16's measurements page,

 * Team's Features raise growth and the market, so Series A comes 23–30 minutes
 * after Seed. The bot places a Search Engine and a WAF as soon as it can. Its
 * autopilot ships Video, Chat, and Checkout in Series A, so media, rt and buy
 * reach its Design. PHP refuses realtime connections, so once Chat is on the
 * backlog the bot migrates to Node.js cluster mode. In Series A it researches
 * Multiple zones first, then spreads its App Servers across two zones and gives
 * every data Node a standby, and raises Series B (91–106 min on seeds 1–5). It moves each CVE patch ticket to the top of
 * the backlog, so no ticket expires into a Data breach.
 * Series C is a placeholder, so the run stops on the clock.
