 * and warmup and runs 60 s. Both hold users, so growth cannot differ.
 *
 * The Pre-seed box at 4,000 users is overloaded, so a change moves revenue a
 * lot. At the Pre-seed start (1,050 users) the change barely moves revenue,
 * and 50 calendar minutes of the diurnal curve move it more than the change.
