 * The stress harness: what the stress boards cost outside of drawing. The big board
 * (61 Nodes, 279 Links) is a player's screenshot. Routing runs on every change to the
 * Design; a tick owes the time it took, so at 10× it steps ten sim seconds, and the
 * Bottleneck search runs once per sim second.
 *
 *   pnpm --filter @quorum/web stress
 *
 * Plain Node, not Vitest: Vitest's module runner puts a getter on every import, which
 * adds more to these hot loops than the code they measure. CI does not run it.
